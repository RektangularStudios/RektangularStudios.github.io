Occulta Novellia is provided as a desktop app within the Novellia Dashboard.

Players connect their wallet to unlock usage of their NFTs. The solution for this functionality is not yet determined. Development begins by wrapping cardano-cli in a sketchy manner.

We target Windows, Mac, and Linux clients first, with potential mobile versions in the future.
