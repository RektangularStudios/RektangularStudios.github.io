Occulta Novellia is a turn-based strategy game set in a surreal horror multiverse. Its combat style is inspired by XCOM, DOS, and Fire Emblem series. The game is a proof of concept for the Novellia platform. The game, along with its NFTs are story focused, with an emphasis on a lack of filler characters.

Players have full ownership of game characters as NFTs in their Cardano wallets. One can play with them in single player and multiplayer modes, or trade them at a marketplace.

The Occulta Novellia game is initially closed source. Multiplayer gameplay will eventually become open-sourced as it is decentralized. Single player will remain closed source. It is supported on the same platforms as the Novellia Dashboard: Linux, Mac, Windows.
