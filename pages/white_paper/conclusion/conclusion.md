Video games pose a unique opportunity for adoption of blockchain technology through the tokenization of in game assets, and the potential to allow decentralized peer-to-peer online multiplayer gaming. The challenges leading to a lack of adoption are high fees associated with blockchain technologies and a lack of domain expertise.

We presented the Novellia platform along with its self-titled governance token, to provide users the ability to democratically develop their stories in silos called multiverses.

To kickstart the usage of this platform, we proposed Occulta Novellia, the turn-based strategy game. It is developed with an authoritative server model and eventually will have components migrated to be decentralized with the help of Hydra.

This provides a leading example for Indie developers and AAA studios to follow in the usage of the Novellia platform, by testing, marketing, and delivering a working proof of concept.
