**The value proposition must identify elements for each of these categories**
- Economics
- Moderation
- Censorship Resistance

**DAO**
- As more developers create content, Novellia (NVLA) has increased demand, while the token has a finite supply.
- Quorum means that a vast majority must actively be in favor of a registration. This puts responsibility of extensive marketing on the proposal maker. Quorum is invariant to the user count for a specific multiverse, so those with low user count cannot easily vote-in low quality content.
- Registrations may be reverted with a reduced quorum over a probationary period. This is if unexpected behavior results from the vote, but there is less motivation to vote for a reversion than a highly marketed registration proposal. For example, game breaking changes, or inappropriate content.
- DAO is completely decentralized, by definition.

**NFTs**
- Denominated in Novellia (NVLA) with finite supply, and minter contracts are deployed with immutable costs at launch time, causing an increase in fiat value as the Novellia ecosystem expands.
- Same quorum requirements as multiverse approvals.
- NFT ownership is non-custodial, by definition. There are no backdoors.

**Decentralized Gameplay**
- Gameplay may include *unregulated mechanics*.
- NFTs retain value despite centralized servers becoming defunct.
- Gameplay related to *unregulated mechanics* is highly verifiable.

**Novellia (NVLA) Governance Token**
- Finite supply means the token is deflationary.
- Use of token for purchasing assets forces the voting power to change hands.
- Staking encourages holding the token for APY rewards.
- Decentralized token distribution leads to better DAO governance.
- Using our own token for the platform means that asset prices are less likely to dissociate from the platform's growth and cause unreasonable jumps in costs. Using ADA would cause a massive price spike in relation to Cardano's network growth.

These elements contribute to a play2earn model, encouraging a monotonically increasing number of players.
