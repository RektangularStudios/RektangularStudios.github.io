The Novellia platform provides software for developers to create a collaborative, decentralized, discrete, multiverses including: games, applications, stories, and artwork. Owners of the Novellia (NVLA) governance token vote to determine consensus and control the direction of each multiverse. Occulta Novellia, a bootstrap game, determines the requirements for the platform as it is developed.

Through the Novellia Dashboard, developers can distribute their games in a decentralized manner. This avoids the censorship and high fees that exist on centralized game markets.
