We present the Novellia platform for developers to create decentralized multiverses encapsulating games, applications, stories, and artwork. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) determines consensus for the development of each multiverse.

The surreal horror universe Occulta Novellia provides a proof of concept for demonstrating the platform's capabilities. It includes a self-titled game Occulta Novellia with rich stories accompanied by tradable NFTs.

A governance token Novellia (NVLA) is used to determine canon for each multiverse. This includes the addition of new games, applications, stories, and artwork. It is the base currency for trading assets within the platform. Assets minted on the platform must be paid for in NVLA, this includes NFTs, unlockable content, and costs to execute dApps.

By providing our game Occulta Novellia, we test the necessary requirements for community tooling and SDKs such that the platform can generalize to a wide variety of functions. Upon the completion of Occulta Novellia, developers have the necessary tooling to extend the platform without our support. This includes open source software such as modding tools for our closed source game, and those for creating additional multiverses.
