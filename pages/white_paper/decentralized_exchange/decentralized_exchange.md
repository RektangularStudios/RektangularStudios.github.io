NFTs can be traded peer-to-peer or through a decentralized exchange provided inside the dashboard. The DEX sorts NFTs by games relevant to you, and allows you to see the complete set of NFTs across all multiverses.

NFTs can be bought or sold for set prices by issuing a smart contract that awaits payment before swapping goods. Smart contracts to facilitate bidding past a minimum price are also supported. These will close after a predefined period of time.

The DEX can also be extended through plugins. The developers intend to provide such a plugin so that Occulta Novellia assets can be tried before they are purchased, in a limited game environment.
