## Welcome to our Wiki!

This is the one-stop shop for all the latest information about
- The Novellia Platform
- The Occulta Novellia video game

We'll be updating our website as well, but a Wiki is the preferred format for a large quantity of information. For this reason, don't be surprised if the website lags behind a bit: it needs to look pretty as well as be informative.

## White paper

Rektangular Studios' initial design work began as a white paper compiled from LaTeX. We quickly realized that it was becoming too big to be maintainable, so we migrated it to a Wiki format. It's much more manageable to read in this format.

While it will no longer be maintained, you can still [access the latest version of the white paper here.](https://rektangularstudios.com/whitepaper)
