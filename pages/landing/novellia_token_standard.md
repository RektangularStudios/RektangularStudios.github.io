Get ready to take back gaming!

The Novellia Platform is a decentralized game marketplace, built on blockchain technology, ultimately reducing fees for everyone, and preventing censorship.

As a first slice in our initiative, we introduce our own metadata standard we feel will better serve the needs of the Novellia marketplace. Feedback is highly welcome. If our format is widely adopted, we expect this to help the Cardano token ecosystem while also ensuring our own tokens are interoperable with as many clients as possible.
