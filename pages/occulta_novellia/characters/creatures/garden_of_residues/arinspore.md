They should never have been allowed to continue their existence, but their quick reproduction has staved all attempts at eradication. These massive spiders feast on all things, small and large. Lacking the ability to feel full, they are permanently on edge, constantly in wait for their next meal.

They consume prey by sticking them to their thorax. A thin ooze generated by its skin slowly melts prey while theyâ€™re alive, screaming until they run out of energy. The carcass of attached victims then falls off. Plomp! And hatches new Arinspore.
