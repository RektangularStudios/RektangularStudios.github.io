The Illieander is a six limbed, flying mantis creature. Its mandible pincers have an immense degree of strength. On its limbs and spine, poisonous barbs sprawl in intricate patterns. When fighting, it is bipedal, or leaps at its prey, gliding with its wings. Otherwise, it maintains a low profile, crawling through the tall grass of the Garden of Residues using all six limbs. Its skin is colorful, but toxic, like a dart frog.
