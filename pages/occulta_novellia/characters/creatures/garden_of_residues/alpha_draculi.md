## Cards

### Alpha Draculi

The Draculi are not restricted to the Garden of Residues' waters. Their stronger brethren roam the land beyond, leading packs of wolf-like underling Draculi. Birthed with a rare, fiery genetic trait, the Alpha Draculi love the taste of blood. They prefer to slowly kill their prey, often letting it sit still alive in their clamped jaws.
