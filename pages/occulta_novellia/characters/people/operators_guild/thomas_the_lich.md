Thomas is Iscara's best friend. Iscara sacrificed everything to resurrect him at the Atrium of Forms, submitting to *Ten Thousand Guns* to heal him. It is likely that her family was dealt with in response to her actions.

Trusting him above anyone else, Iscara made Thomas her right-hand, or second in command of the Operator's Guild.

Having spent too long across the threshold of death, he has a knack for conjuration.
