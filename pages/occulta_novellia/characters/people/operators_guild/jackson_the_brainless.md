Childhood friend of Iscara and Thomas. Thomas was always Iscara's favorite, which made Jackson jealous, although happy for him.

Killed by a bullet to the head, Jackson has none of his memories, despite being revived by *Ten Thousand Guns*. He enjoys the company of Iscara and Thomas who tell him stories of their childhoods.

He finds it easy to alter his sense of self, his limited experience meaning little attachment to his human form. Jackson is able to shapeshift and teach other *tainted* within the Guild.

*Is that a sword sticking through my torso? Why didn't anyone tell me? --Jackson the Brainless*
