Rumor has it that a war occurred. So many guns, so many lives. So much that something took an interest. It became aware of the scene so vividly that it became it. As if the swarm of bullets and steel barrels had become its limbs: something that consciousness could grip as a body.

## The Orbit of Lives

Let **G** be a group. We refer to the orbit of an element of **G** as those which can be reached by applying the group operator.

I'm thinking of you, the perspectives through time, of love and hate. I'm trying to find the center. A place without my own perspective, only you, what I'm looking at. The raw entity without the blur of my own emotion and sensation.

The form at the center.

Prettier than she looks, it's always a function of me: the eye of the beholder.

I want to see what you look like, without me. Without anyone.

It doesn't exist.

The experience of yourself: is that the center?

I want to be you. To devour the possibilities. Find the most creative timeline. Only you can remove me, from this. Reality?

That's why, Iscara, I grant you *Ten Thousand Guns*.
