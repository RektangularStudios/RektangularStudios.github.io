Raptor thought the Grevan artillery moved too slowly, so raptor stole a cannon off of one so he wouldn't have to wait around for it. Basically the same thing, right?

Armed with his prized IC-V, intercontinental cannon, mark V, he'll either wipe out the opposition, or blow off his shoulder if he forgets to mount it on a hard surface. Conservation officers would panic watching him use trees in a forest for cover.

He carries a bundle of zip ties and cuffs on his belt, but only because he's legally required to. He won't need a lawyer to use the machete hanging from his right-hip on a chain though.

*Prisoners? What Prisoners?*
