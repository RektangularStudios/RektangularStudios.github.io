Every playable character is a collectible asset!

## What exactly are the collectibles?

Collectible assets are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) which are stored on the Cardano blockchain. These NFTs are issued by smart contracts in limited amounts.

## Where are my collectible assets (aka NFTs) stored?

Your own collectibles are stored in your blockchain wallet(s) making you the sole owner of them.

## What are the collectible assets used for? 

As long as you own a character's collectible asset, meaning that it's in your connected wallet, the character will be playable for you in the game!

## Can I do anything other than play Occulta Novellia with my collectible assets?

You can buy them with NVLA or sell them for NVLA  in our official in-game community marketplace!
