They surround the Grevan capitol, Ixis, making it nearly impossible to assault. I aim my laser at a tree near me, but it doesn’t appear.

Stage Descriptions  Stage 1: These are the only characters that can be deployed at the start of a match. The others must be swapped in through gained experience. Only stage 1 characters have a squad slot and base stats.  Stage 2: These can replace a stage 1 character once it has enough experience in a match. Upper stages replace attributes and base stats.  Stage 3: These can replace a stage 2 character once it has enough experience in a match. Upper stages replace attributes and base stats. Draculi is a stage 1 collectible. There are multiple possible progressions for a class. If “Cannibal Draculi” and “Pack Draculi” are both stage 2 characters, either can be chosen as the stage 1 Draculi’s progression. This must be decided prior to the start of the match during a staging phase. If there are multiple stage 1 Draculi deployed, the player cannot use the same NFT multiple times to design both progressions. In this case, the player would need to collect multiple of each upper level NFT, and mutiple stage 1 Draculi to accompany. This encourages collecting multiplicities of a single card, increasing market demand. Attributes: Attributes are stored as a string array on the NFT. Draculi has attributes “Agile”, “Swim”, “Bite”, which are stored as literal words on the NFT. There is no additional data to determine the definition for these words. That is the job of the game’s card engine. The attributes are interpreted into a combination of activated and passive abilities. This interpretation is subject to change based on the version of the game client, or mods, for balancing purposes. This is a compromise. The attributes cannot be removed from the NFT itself. This preserves value: even if one interpreter version devalues the attributes, another may provide a different interpretation. Draculi’s Attributes  Bite is an attack move that costs action points.  Swim means that Draculi can move across water terrain.  Agile gives Draculi a higher than normal chance to avoid incoming attacks. Slots: In Occulta Novellia, characters are deployed in squads with an average capacity of 4 slots, but this can vary for each map. The slots stat indicates how much space Draculi takes within a squad. Slots typically range from 1-4, with the following categories  1 Slot: Generic or weaker characters such as Draculi, Grevan Rifleman, Phanamite Autoneer.  2 Slots: Heroes or leaders such as Iscara, Thomas, Laurence, Garret.  3 Slots: Brutes, heavy hitters, or large creatures such as Raptor, Arinspore.  4 Slots: Legendary or very powerful units such as Iskadiel, Ten Thousand Guns, Phanasmac. If a player needs to fill a squad of capacity 4, they might choose 4 Draculi, or 1 Draculi and 1 Arinspore. Base Stats: These are stored as mandatory integers on the NFT. There may also be extended stats which determine the degree of ability related to certain attributes. Categories  Health indicates how much damage Draculi can take before dying.  Each squad shares a fixed number of action points. These do not regenerate fully every turn, but recover slowly. This means if one character performs too many actions in a turn, another character in the same squad has insufficient action points to do anything. Move indicates how many action points it costs for every hex tile the character crosses.  Attack indicates how much damage Draculi deals, multiplied by an integer associated with its bite move. The multiplier is not stored on the NFT, so it can be altered for balancing purposes. "

    "body": "The Novellia platform exposes a set of distinct contract whitelists for each multiverse. These whitelists enumerate the content authorized to interact with dApps related to its respective multiverse. This is an opt-in policy for dApps, but conformance to an API is necessary for autonomous extension and approval of community content. dApps are not required to register if they are only consumers. They can provide their own core functionality or be closed source. A dApp is incentivized to register on-chain smart contracts or NFTs for interoperability with other consumers. dApps may register to multiple multiverses, but assets may incidentally fail to generalize to other multiverses except when using a purely consumer model. This is the case for an exchange. Proposals to mutate a multiverse’s whitelist are restricted to that multiverse. A voter must own assets registered to a multiverse to vote on proposals relevant to it. This ownership is defined by the existence of an NFT in the voter’s wallet. All voting is done with the Novellia (NVLA) token to avoid a fractured economy. This supports the creation of a never-ending story, or multiverse, without allowing for degradation of content. Examples of this use-case include fan fiction, story based games with a continuous canon such as card games, and games with many extensions that need to be canonicalized (MMOs with many popular story directions). A nominal proposal registration fee prevents sybil attacks. It also incentivizes active voting, as the fee is paid to participants. Assets registered on the DAO do not extend the DAO. They may interact as they are designed to, but this is not facilitated as a function of the DAO, nor does the DAO take on the security burden. This separation of affairs means that one might want to register multiple contracts for a single functionality, or suggest revisions to existing contracts. The dashboard application supports a standard API for contracts to implement, allowing them to appear on it, but this is not explicitly supported by the DAO. Other hub-like applications may define their own APIs. The DAO supports minimal functionality for consensus purposes  Adding or updating of smart contracts.  The removal of smart contracts.

This is abstracted such that the backend can easily be upgraded as decentralization features become available. This section is designed based on the current version of Hydra and does not consider alternative designs such as sharding. The play model makes sense for Occulta Novellia and similar turn-based games. The process may also be extensible to other dApp variants. We do not attempt to discuss them here. To initiate a match, a player is required to send the NFTs they are using to a locking contract. This automatically returns the NFTs when a match is completed. This prevents the player from starting multiple matches using the same NFTs, decreasing the prevalence of bots and other sybil attacks. When a match is started  The initial state is check-pointed onto the L1 Cardano blockchain.  A Hydra head is opened for cheaper transactions.  If consensus fails within the Hydra head, it is ejected back to the L1 Cardano blockchain to determine the result. This creates another checkpoint.  If a player leaves the game and pausing is allowed for asynchronous play the Hydra head ejects after a period of time. The Hydra head needs to be reopened before a time set at the match’s inception or the match is forfeited. Players must manually trigger changes to the game state since smart contracts do not execute autonomously. Gameplay is defined in a transcriptable manner like tournament Chess.

    "body": "Am I locked in if I decide to use Novellia?: No. You select what features are beneficial for your product. Is this a proposal for a platform or a game?: Yes. We are building the video game Occulta Novellia in order to help test the systems needed to build the Novellia Platform. What is the Novellia Platform?: The platform is a set of tools designed for video games to interact with the Cardano blockchain. The Novellia Dashboard acts as a decentralized game store. The tools provided allow developers to pick and choose blockchain features to use in their video game. These tools, while optional, provide a formally reviewed standard that ensures certain design provision are met, including that assets within Novellia are hard to devalue by design. Our process:  Plan Review Rework Follow-up Keep iteratingIf it isn’t finished, it isn’t shipped. What is Occulta Novellia?: It’s a surreal horror turn-based strategy monster fighting game. You will be able to fight through single player story lines, giving you a better understanding of the multiverse, or fight in decentralized peer-to-peer battles, with rewards going to the victor. I don’t get it? Why do we need the Occulta Novellia video game?: Because designing a platform is hard. It’s more difficult when there’s nothing to test against. We could wait until it’s finished, but then it’d be too late. Occulta Novellia efficiently forces us to ensure the platform conforms to real-life scenarios, not an ideal. What is Novellia if it’s not just a dashboard?: The Novellia platform exposes a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where holders of the Novellia (NVLA) token vote to determine what’s allowed into the Novellia Dashboard. The dashboard is just a UI that surfaces everything that’s been registered on the DAO, allowing it to be interacted with all in one place. How do I get my game on Novellia?: Registration on the DAO involves:  Filling out a middleware that is proposed to the DAO.  If the proposal passes, the middleware is registered.  This is the developer’s “personal space” on the DAO.      They are free to modify the data within some reasonable restrictions.    That’s it. So I’m going to make $0 off my game because people will buy used only?: If you want to. Otherwise, you could create multiple game license kinds. Perhaps there’s a 10% chance that a buyer will get a special game license unlocking an extra skin, level, or something else. How do I make blockchain assets for my game?: We provide minter standards for:  Native Tokens NFTs Semi-fungible TokensThese can be modified at will. The value is in the design behind the standard. When your team is ready to mint assets, they don’t need to do any research. By following our standard, assets can be included in the Novellia Marketplace, provided in the Novellia Dashboard. This happens automatically. How do I see my blockchain assets?: The Novellia Dashboard exposes a read-only wallet interface which allows highly unique tokens such as NFTs to be displayed without a loss of information. For NFTs like trading cards, information such as artwork, skills, gameplay, won’t appear in any typical wallet. Our interface is extensible with plugins so anyone can get a first-class view of their holdings. Can I trade within the Novellia platform?: Yes. The Novellia Dashboard contains a decentralized marketplace that allows users to purchase new assets from conformant minting contracts, or trade those same assets on a resale market. Is this totally decentralized and non-custodial?: Yes. All data required for the dashboard’s functioning is enumerated from the Cardano blockchain. We are non-custodial. Connect your wallet using a plugin similar to MetaMask. Hardware Wallet / Software Wallet → Integration Layer → Accessed safely by game Why do we need a DAO? Why do projects need to voted on?: The DAO helps filter out low quality content (buggy, inappropriate, scams) without requiring a centralized authority. This means that content cannot be censored. What game engines are supported?: We’ll begin by implementing an engine agnostic set of tools, followed by specific integrations for whatever is most in demand. Why do I want my game to be on Novellia?: We provide a low-fee ecosystem to help you hit the ground running.  Marketplace     Very low fees. Avoid those +20% app store fees!   Earn commissions on resale markets for blockchain assets.     Open source software (for critical plugins. the dashboard will begin as closed-source)     Fix it yourself if you need it now.    Read the code and you can know there’s no backdoors.     Decentralization     Your game can’t be censored for being too scary or for arbitrary political reasons.     Identity     Users know they aren’t buying copy-cat blockchain assets because they’re purchasable directly within Novellia.    Are we a scam?: No. This is a scam Useless Ethereum Token. "

The graphics depict these environments in full 3D. Dialogue sequences are presented as text with animated character sprites, similar to RPGs such as Fire Emblem. Multiplayer Battlegrounds  Prepare your team of tradable characters and get ready for a fierce fight on the battlegrounds against other players! Fight for glory in small or large battles ranging in size of up to 60+ characters at once! Weak alone, legendary together! Create a team of multiple squads, comprised of characters with different and adaptive play-styles for dynamic battles. Combat  Play smart to crush your opponents! Individual play-styles are highly punishable by coherent squads. That’s why teamwork is key! Squads function on shared time, not everyone can do everything! Watch your characters progress in battles! Use story cards to hone or pivot your characters’ play-style according to skills and events happening in the Occulta Novellia story-lines.  Character or battleground specific environmental effects have an important impact on winning! Battle occurs on hex tiles connected through interesting locations in Regalia. Placement and formations are critical! Keep it simple! Characters have sane value ranges in the low integers! Matches occur across multiple rounds. Make no sacrifices! Characters suffer permadeath, but survivors recover in-between rounds. Your NFTs are never lost, this only applies to the scope of individual matches or campaigns.  Retreat! Don’t forfeit all your characters in a tilted battle, withdraw to survive the next round! Characters sets are released periodically, adding new mechanics or breathing life into old ones!"

The concept of sensation is fractured. Its inhabitants tell travelers to try not to hear the colors or taste the sounds because they will succeed and not return. The garden emanates a feeling, like a tint to reality, giving strength to those things with an affinity for madness. The inhabitants are afflicted with a kind of directed psychosis, ideas flowing in identifiable currents like wind, perfectly awake, but perhaps not the smartest. It is dim in lighting, but full of vibrant colors, laced with vines and flowers. A path built of a stone material seems immune to the overgrowth: the flora will not touch it or grow through it. Immaculate, like a freshly paved sidewalk, it carves a path to someplace deep within Aphantasia. A few holes exist around the walkway: shallow ponds. In their depths are huge things that cast black, dot-like shadows. Some smaller snakes swim near the surface, but attempts to dive reveal that the water has an impenetrable, glass-like floor just a few feet deep. It’s too shallow to swim along the bottom without drowning, as the different openings do not connect. The sparse inhabitants of the garden embody a drowsy head-space. They are relatively docile as a whole, unless aggravated. The selection of creatures is intended to provide some variety, especially in having at least one type per terrain format: water, land, flying. This provides a basis for testing some game mechanics.

Unable to operate, he has replaced some of his parts such that he can defeat his talented foes. Garret, ravaged by a flesh-eating virus as a child, is severely incapacitated. By some miracle, the neurological effects seem to have actually improved his cognition. Recognizing his limitations in controlling his self-modifications, Laurence realizes that he isn’t smart enough. He offers to work on Garret, teaching him to duel. No one would treat Garret before, for fear of killing him, incurring the wrath of the Phanamites’ laws regarding the preservation of life. Realizing how much he’s missed out on, Garret sends his human evolution farther than Laurence ever intended or thought was possible. “Laurence, put this into the servo. I’ve fixed the power issues. ” “I thought you said it was experimental?” “Do you want to win the duel or not?” Laurence applies the perpetual motor, sending sparks throughout Garret’s apparatus. “How do you feel?” “Well, I’m still not dead, not yet. ” “Shut. Up. Get out there, and win, come on man! If this thing works, you won’t have any power issues this time. ” Garret steps into the illegal arena, hoping to double his and Laurence’s money. The nervous implant whirrs. Garret is itchy all over as his nerves rejuvenate. The metallic coverings dig into the gaps in his flesh, sometimes hooking into the bone. He’ll have to fasten the attachments later. They’ll loosen during combat. He swings the sword attached to his right hand, allowing a computer to calibrate its weight model for it. By optimizing the expenditure of energy, Garret won’t ever need to decelerate, moving as fast as humanly possible. He amps his eyes until they feel like they’re on fire. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to his own bodily displacement. After the fight, he’ll have to put a covering on his eyes and shut them down so they can heal. "

This contract is required to support at a minimum  Returning NFTs in exchange for Novellia (NVLA) deposits Be immutableWhile asset pricing in Novellia (NVLA) is not strictly enforced by the DAO, voting for such contracts would be disincentivized, since voters hold Novellia (NVLA). Game theory dictates they would be devaluing their own assets. These contracts are registered on the DAO so they cannot be duplicated. Clones would simply fail to be voted into the DAO, preserving the value of rare NFTs, while allowing easy deployment of welcome additions. This maintains a registry of origin for NFTs. Most NFTs such as playable characters in Occulta Novellia are minted according to a discrete probability distribution, with infinite supply. The fixed Novellia (NVLA) cost combined with its increasing fiat value induces rarity over time, as it becomes infeasible to purchase more NFTs from the minter. The Novellia (NVLA) price is adjusted by a function with respect to the number of NFTs minted for a given contract. This stops the creator of a minter from purchasing their own NFTs at net zero cost. There are also limited edition NFTs which are minted with finite supply contracts. As it becomes available, we may allow oracles to denominate asset prices in a stable coin. The developers avoid this as it would cause old NFTs to suddenly become worthless if the value of USD rapidly depreciated. The instability of Novellia (NVLA) is a necessary poison, and would become a non-issue as it grew in market-cap to become stable in value. There may be limited edition collectibles wearing Santa hats, for example, minted around the winter holidays. Stay tuned for Draculi variants. "

Either by creating application cross-compatible NFTs or providing similar functionality using incompatible NFTs as a proof of ownership or authorization for features. A weapon NFT may authorize airdropping an equivalent NFT for a totally separate application. The Novellia DAO provides an authorization layer for NFTs to be used across multiple applications. This prevents the minting of NFTs from arbitrary smart contracts that might otherwise devalue a game’s economy. The listing of NFTs denominated in NVLA results in the perpetual increase of asset value as the token itself appreciates.

We refer to the orbit of an element of G as those which can be reached by applying the group operator. I’m thinking of you, the perspectives through time, of love and hate. I’m trying to find the center. A place without my own perspective, only you, what I’m looking at. The raw entity without the blur of my own emotion and sensation. The form at the center. Prettier than she looks, it’s always a function of me: the eye of the beholder. I want to see what you look like, without me. Without anyone. It doesn’t exist.

    "body": "Thomas, her childhood friend, and could have been lover, lies crumpled on the stone floor. The crown operator has just ordered the Grevan soldiers to shoot him. He refused to be conscripted. Citizens with the ability to operate are too dangerous not to be processed. The Atrium of Forms, a complex filled with statues of mythical creatures from a time long past, brings out skills in those who enter it. Other to-be conscripts stand in line, hoping the crown operator will overlook them, deeming them only useful as soldiers or for the conventional workforce. Filled with rage, Iscara realizes she can feel the atrium, as if the walls, creatures, extend the feeling of her skin. The mural on the southern wall glows as she subconsciously pries it open, permitting a black fog to enter. Beyond it lies the impassible region of Aphantasia, a cold, desolate place. Yet through the mural, now morphed into an opened gate, is a mysterious garden full of lush life. It takes my left arm, claiming it can give me the strength of ten thousand guns in exchange. I let it, I don’t know why. When the soldiers fill me with lead, the bullet holes don’t heal, but I get up. Nerves wrecked, feeling stuck, I don’t think I can feel my hands. The crown operator emits a haze to keep the black fog at bay. Suddenly, I visualize my friends, armed with rifles like the soldiers, stacked up on the marble columns. The scene shifts. Tick. Tick. Tick. There’s a firefight ongoing. Somehow my friends got weapons. The crown operator takes a defensive stance, analyzing Iscara carefully. There’s a voice in her head now, not quite the most helpful. You like Thomas? What should I take? His pretty face? I’ll bring him back for you. “You shouldn’t have done that,” Iscara remarks to Iskadiel, the crown operator, pointing at the body on the floor. “It’s not too late,” she frowns, nearly paralyzed by what she knows, but Iscara does not. “I can kill you before it takes hold,” her voice is genuine. The stump where Iscara’s arm was, it bleeds. The soldiers, they fight with a renewed strength, almost madly. The way one would if the safety of their families had been put to the test. Click. Jackson, Thomas’ best friend becomes brainless, a round piercing his skull. “No thanks,” Iscara says calmly, face contorted in dissonance with her pretty dress. "

    "title": "Ten Thousand Guns: Slide Puzzle",
    "body": "Let me tell you a tale of human puzzles…: The people dance wildly around a bonfire. With sane mania, they lance around in a circle, swinging off of each other, letting booze do its part in making their creature closeness comfortable. One man starts chanting something incoherent, and the others chant back, like the spokesperson at a concert telling the audience to get riled up. Except they’re all the spokesperson and they’re all riled up, and they’re all playing their instruments louder than they should be. This dreary guy is leaning against a tree, just thinking to himself, “It’s deafening. ”  He’s just another guy in plain clothes. He looks like all the others, and sometimes he wonders if that’s not unintentional. Sometimes he wonders if he can look not like someone else. His tree is only a few meters from the fire. It rages strong, fuelled by a stack of chopped logs. He knows the fire is really hot, but he doesn’t feel all that warm. The cool night breeze has intermixed with the generated heat, leaving him lukewarm. He likes it: he’s not shivering nor sweating. His hands relax at his sides. He was probably just picking at his nails. He sometimes does that out of boredom, but sometimes he wonders if it’s because he’s nervous and doesn’t notice it. His head leans back against the rough texture of the bark behind him, thinking, “How did I get here?” Of course, he walked to the campsite like all the others, he’s thinking a bit more abstractly. He holds out a hand and moves it longitudinally to his opposite side, like drawing a non-existent sword from a non-existent sheathe. He knows that he felt his hand move, feeling the air resist against the nerves on his exposed skin, but he fails to resolve the recursion of causation. It’s like he’s a painting and there’s this artist streaking brilliant lines across the canvas. Every time a detail is filled in, he thinks, “I did this,” but did he? Or is he like the pixels on a screen where the people are just a pattern the viewer picks out. He wonders if he’s really here at all, or some noise in space that’s convinced itself it exists. He thinks to himself, how could he see his hand moving if he does exist at a point in time? The moments of motion are instantaneous, how could he see them unless he was a width of time, not an instant? He smirks at that, deciding to do something trippy. He moves his hand again, but this time he does it in short segments. He moves an inch, then remembers the entirety of the sensation, replaying it. He does this repeatedly until he can replay the segments all at once, as if compressing ten seconds into a single instant. He feels as if his arm is at all the places at once. It’s wordless, something unexplainable, but a feeling that exists separate from the parts, like the rapid recognition of a human shape in the dark after scanning up and down. Like tracing a circle of ideas around a word that can’t be pronounced, until you trip into it, and say it. If he’s honest, he’s kind of bored of the party. He can make it a lot more exciting. He chuckles to himself, knowing that he’s not exactly sane. But neither is what happens next. He sketches a table into the dancing crowd, watching how the bodies subconsciously move around the non-existent visualization: the ground is lava. When the table is erased, the crowd floods the spot again. The mild confusion makes him smirk impishly. As if his experience were a set of numerical values, once restricted to all the evens, he adds the odds. He notices an extension to his experience as he projects his sense of self around the party, memorizing everything. His amped mind lets the false neurology intermingle with his reality, until it feels like he can see every side of every object at once. The trees really. Pop! In full 3D. He wishes he could extend the space and see a tesseract. But that might scare the humans before he gets to the real fun. “That’s better”, he mutters to himself. Not in awe of his expanded perspective, but intent on completing the next step. He listens to the owls cooing, and the insects chirping. Relaxing for a moment as his nerves settle. Then he leans harder into the tree as if hanging onto a rollercoaster. What does a person hang onto when it’s themselves they’re trying to grasp? What a predicament! He focuses on each individual voice, one by one forcing his focus to expand until they’re all crystal clear. And way too loud. He’s losing his grip. Like overclocking a graphics card, the pixels of his vision start changing abruptly at random intervals. The colors themselves are shaking throughout the visible spectrum. The sounds fracture, he hears things humans cannot hear, making his registers clip into unknown sensory spaces. He clutches at his stomach, feeling the unnatural sensations cause temporary damage to his nervous system as he pushes himself harder than he knows he should; like mental weights, where the burn is felt as veritable psychosis. He moves his phantom hands. Or, more accurately, he replays the sensations of moving hands, identifying them as his own. He reaches to the ground with both of his phantom limbs, extending his existence to the ground. “I am the soil,” he mutters. It pulls him in like a magnet, the planet’s movement akin to the turning of his own head, as if he could move rivers by volition alone. He lifts his phantom hands to his right side, singing in his head but also with larynx, “I am the space that surrounds. ” The feeling of difference between the people in the crowd, the planet, and himself, dissipates. He identifies deeply with the space itself, as the way one doesn’t identify the individual particles in their flesh. “Do I move, or is it the world that moves around me while I stand in place?” he asks himself rhetorically. The lucid sensation of unreality shakes him to his core as he imagines the sensations that would come with having all of his limbs removed one by one, having them reattached in random permutations. He’s Humpty Dumpty, a figure as simple as to be drawn on a napkin and torn up. He struggles to move his physical body, as his nervous system approaches a crashing point. In fact, his eyes have rolled back into his head, and a burning sensation has filled his entirety. Worse than a million pills of Xanax stopped cold turkey. He is emotionless. The waves of happy, awe, the responsiveness that comes from being aware, vanishes into catatonia. His being is a many years broken arm, cast removed, atrophied nerves, completely immobile. He wants to die. So he forces a hallucination. Where he envisions himself stepping out of his now incapacitated body, which lies on the hard ground coughing up blood in a violent manner. He dissociates so as not to be troubled by his physical problems. He can’t stay in this heightened state of awareness for too long, nothing imaginable could reverse the damage, as existence itself would seem to cascade into a new state of affairs, crossing the veil of no return. To him, it would be as if he had been dreaming his whole life up from fantasy, and that he was just a figment of some other thing’s imagination. He does not want to wake up. He does not believe in oblivion, but in promised synaesthesia relevant to the decaying of his brain at the atomic level. He won’t go there: he knows there is nothing scarier than what he is incapable of understanding or controlling. He’s ready. “The people are too loud,” he mutters to himself, still keeled over, but no longer hurting, “let’s shut them up. ” He summons a force completely inhuman, a motion in the direction pure agony and hatred, but without a bottom, he falls infinitely, accelerating the force to a divergent limit. The degrees to which he wants to creatively damage the crowd is infinite, like a story book where the pages never end, and the story never becomes cliche. He gets a headache as he resolves the sequence of actions he wants to focus on. It pisses him off that he can’t do all of them at once, the way an obsessive person wants to split themselves to follow every path of a maze, not knowing which will be the right one. He pictures the partying men being torn apart, then stitched together again, fully alive in the process. He sees this on repeat, but focuses in on one in particular. This individual is cut apart into a grid, and like a puzzle, has its squares mixed and matched around. It’s like one of those puzzles where a square is missing, and the pieces need to be shifted around to complete a picture. Except this picture is that of a nude man, scrambled, where all the pieces are still alive. He observes how the five squares that were the man’s diaphragm continue to pulse in and out for air, as if the images were breathing. He observes the man’s face contorted into an artificially extended smile, literally ripped at the seams, as it changes from vicious smile to horrid frown, back and forth from mania to depression, gory crimson crying all over the pretty green grass. In wonder at the man’s state of happy-sad mind, Ten locates the squares that were the man’s brain, and sees that the circuits are shifting about in funny ways, causing what one might call emotional turmoil. Ten inquires abstractly to the agony force, asking if it can do anything more fun. It seems to smirk. The puzzle changes to also contain a nude woman. “Perfect, they’re so naturally suited for one another,” Ten admits, purely analytically. She’s torn into a puzzle. She screams constantly. She just won’t. Shut. Up. Ten giggles, wondering if he’s as deranged as the literally scrambled brains. “Look, they’re having sex, and in a rather weird position too!” The man’s pieces are torn away to coalesce with the woman, sliding the square randomly together. Their genitals are so shredded throughout the overall picture that it’s tough to say exactly what they’re doing, except that they both find it extremely pleasurable: in spite of the fact that their bodies are so verily damaged. Even on a purely mental level, the finest of philosophers or puzzle solvers alike would never be able to separate the two people into coherently separate beings. Unconsciously, Ten has affected the rest of the crowd with the violent force. Dispersed blanket of eyes all look at him at once, frightened. They blink like the sounds of grasshoppers at night. “I’m fine, go enjoy yourselves!” Ten shouts joyously. The pieces crash to the ground, stuck in their puzzled reality. Who knows if they can even die like this? The ground becomes very cold, impassible. “Don’t worry! Someone will be here, eventually!” He vanishes, as formless as he was before he arrived. Don’t stop dancing! But. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. A group of partying campers who wouldn’t shut up. Ten scrambled them into a really complicated slide puzzle. Who knows, maybe if they survive, they’ll evolve into something really cool? "

    "body": " Chapter 1: “Iscara, I’m afraid to ask, it’s been so long. I can’t remember, how is it we came to Aphantasia?” The Operator’s Guild has few mirrors in their stronghold, even in the master chamber. Jackson avoids them, having yet to see the way his brain deformed around his skull,squeezed out by the bullet that killed him. Iscara is not without her own wounds. Bullet holes riddle her torso, the moonlight illuminating them likea child’s flashlight pointing stencils at a wall. She sits at the head of the executive table, having foregone a throne she could have had. Jackson’s spot is better, away from the glare of light entering from a large window. Grabbing her rifle, she aims it out, eyeing a pack of Draculi. The water-snakes with fangs and human jaws,are circling a spherical spider, with arms distributed for reach in any direction. The Arinspore ingests itsopposition by sticking them to itself and absorbing them, alive, with a sticky acid. A few humans are screaming relentlessly, having been stuck to its thorax. Their heads look melted. Iscara tries not to think about what that would feel like. “Jackson,” she starts, “it’s only been a few days. ” “It feels like I’ve existed for a few hours at most. ” His temporal horizon for memory must be very short. “Maybe we can fix that. ” Jackson looks down, ashamed, relenting at the idea of needing help. The heat of a nearby fireplace warms his composure back up. Iscara of Grevania continues, “We were just young Grevans, and they wanted to make us pawns. Soldiers in their own stupid war, Jackson. ” “But, I can’t feel my hands anymore. It’s like a dream. It wasn’t always like this. ” She feels a tactile sensation, wrapping around her wrists, bending invisibly into her bones. As if there’s a second flow of blood, she struggles to differentiate and manipulate it. Jackson’s head warps into that of a snake, but retaining his masculine jaw, and growing fangs of dripping, bright red bone. He feels the tactile motion as well. If he tries, he can feel the entire room as if its surface were his skin. “You try too hard. Let go. Try to remember the way your body morphed from child to adult, growing, but into something else. ” He looks around, at nothing in particular, flexing his snake neck. “We died Jackson, that’s why you can’t feel your hands. Let me tell you about Ten Thousand Guns. ” A voice whirrs within Iscara’s head, excited that someone wants to talk about it. Chapter 2: Thomas, her childhood friend, and could have been lover, lies crumpled on the stone brick floor. His chest is riddled with bullets, mouth open in awe, blood pooling around his body. It’s drying, becoming a darker, sticky color. Iscara glances over her shoulder. Her friends are stacked behind statues of creatures, and the pillars supportingthe Atrium of Forms. The Grevan soldiers exchange rounds with the young adults that refused a gruelling conscription. Click. Click. Click. Jackson takes a bullet to the head. Click. Click. Click. Her cute face is angry. Iscara approaches Iskadiel at the center of the atrium, rifle in hand. “You’d have made a good operator,” Iskadiel remarks. A burst of lead throws Iscara back a few feet. Her muscles twitch, nervous system feels jammed. Dead. But the massive mural on the atrium’s southern wall glows, fading to reveal a garden full of flora andimmaculately designed architecture. Bridges span across rivers and ponds, as if the ravines belowthe floating Atrium of Forms had been filled with water in a parallel universe. Black fog emanates from the door. Iskadiel raises her hands, emitting a kind of aura, like if the gray noise inone’s vision had tinted a few shades brighter. The crown operator is afraid, she doubts her return to the Grevan capitol. Iscara’s wounds don’t heal, but she gets up. A voice beckons, manifesting as symbols overlaid on her vision, as dancing shapes, and sounds she can see. You’re not dead yet. I’ll give you the strength of Ten Thousand Guns. "

Quorum means that a vast majority must actively be in favor of a registration. This puts responsibility of extensive marketing on the proposal maker. Quorum is invariant to the user count for a specific multiverse, so those with low user count cannot easily vote-in low quality content.  Registrations may be reverted with a reduced quorum over a probationary period. This is if unexpected behavior results from the vote, but there is less motivation to vote for a reversion than a highly marketed registration proposal. For example, game breaking changes, or inappropriate content.  DAO is completely decentralized, by definition. NFTs  Denominated in Novellia (NVLA) with finite supply, and minter contracts are deployed with immutable costs at launch time, causing an increase in fiat value as the Novellia ecosystem expands.  Same quorum requirements as multiverse approvals.  NFT ownership is non-custodial, by definition. There are no backdoors. Decentralized Gameplay  Gameplay may include unregulated mechanics.  NFTs retain value despite centralized servers becoming defunct.  Gameplay related to unregulated mechanics is highly verifiable. Novellia (NVLA) Governance Token  Finite supply means the token is deflationary.  Use of token for purchasing assets forces the voting power to change hands.  Staking encourages holding the token for APY rewards.  Decentralized token distribution leads to better DAO governance.  Using our own token for the platform means that asset prices are less likely to dissociate from the platform’s growth and cause unreasonable jumps in costs. Using ADA would cause a massive price spike in relation to Cardano’s network growth. These elements contribute to a play2earn model, encouraging a monotonically increasing number of players. "

These actions include adding new games and dApps to specific multiverses which are then surfaced in the Dashboard desktop application. There are actions to add and remove the multiverses themselves. Voting is a function of actively participating Novellia (NVLA) holders and the token’s total supply. We do not introduce the use of NFTs or additional assets. These may not have a finite supply or may be subject to centralized authorities. All voting parameters can be changed by a vote. Voting parameters  Percentage quorum of Novellia (NVLA) tokens with respect to total supply. E. g. 20% Probation period to have a reduced reversal quorum requirement. This is a factor multiplied against the other quorum parameters. E. g. 0. 625 * 80% = 50%. A majority vote is not actually 50% of the total supply. The percent of tokens actively used for voting may be much lower. Token holders must set initial parameters by voting until they arerepresentative of the circulating supply. There would be a transitional period where only voting parameters could be voted on, prior to allowing proposals for other DAO actions. The initial quorum would be set extremely low such that the voting parameters would be set to slightly less than the percent of active voters. The voting quorum is designed to disincentivize low quality content from being registered. Token holders are rewarded in Novellia (NVLA) for voting. The proposal maker incentivizes people to actively vote for or against them in order to receive rewards that they supply as a cost for creating the proposal. To prevent setting the quorum parameter to a malicious value, it is illegal to set it beyond an interval derived as a function of the percent of active voters. Such as proposal would automatically be rejected. Here we have presented a minimal concept for a voting implementation.
